A simple Project I am working on to better understand using company web APIs.

At the moment. The user inputs a sumoner name to be looked up.
Once entered, the program accesses riots API pulls the summoners Champions played this season and prints it out as a list.
Also, each champion will also return how many penta-kills it has gotten this season.

I'm looking at creating a GUI for this to see if i can make it into a small app. Plus, i have never worked with a lot of GUI's 
before so i am wanting to learn how to achieve that.
