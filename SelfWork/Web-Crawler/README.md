The point of this project.

I was always facinated on how google scraped the web. I had no clue on how it was done.
I was essentially trying to learn the very basics of web crawlers. 
I chose Python because i read that beautifulSoup is a good library for pulling tags and information from HTML and XML.

This program just simply scrapes Amazon.com for all its urls and pastes them into a txt document. 
In the console, it will return numbers which correlate to the number of links found!
