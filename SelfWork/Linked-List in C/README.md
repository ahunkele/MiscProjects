The point of this program was to simply familiarize myself with C.

I figured the best way to do so is to creat a simple data structure! 
I decided to go with a interactive command prompt for this program which allowes the users to make calls to the program.

This program helped me learn a lot about C and weak-typed programming languages in general.
