My partnet and i Dakota Langdon completed the assignment with Animation, Diffuse Lighting, Camera Translation, Light filtering etc. 

To use our program, you first pick a source color and then a color to blend the source with. Now that you have the
source color repetidly tap the filter button until you get the filter color you want. then hit cast and the 3rd block with have the filter light 
casted on it. 

its like this because i was not sure how to add more buttons.
