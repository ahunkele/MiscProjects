The graph of the original appears to fit O(n) time complexity. However, it is possible that it fits O(n^2) in a larger test scenario
this is due to the way the graph curves towrds the end of the test. 

The first one checks the adjacent blocks gor every node that is inside the list. It then appends it into said list when it is the same color.
The reason this one take longer than our second flood function is because its checks dopes not utalize the space correctly. it traverses 
we need a more optimal stratagy for checking the adjacent blocks. 

With the second flood functon. The graph is almost identical to the first. However, the overall time it took for each test was much lower.
We fiexd our time issues with shortening our code and making less variables. This freed up a lot of memory and the overall funcation was just much more concise.
The code is aslo much more simple to look at. It becomse easier to tell what exactly it is doing.
