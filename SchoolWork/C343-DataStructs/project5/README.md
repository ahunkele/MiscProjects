Worked with Joel Park

minimum function takes the 0th element from the min heapified array and returnes it. That 0th elem is the smallest int. 

insert just appends the obj to the array and then runs build min heap to sort it. 

extract min just saves the min and then deletes it and returns the saved min value

min_heapify sorts at a given indecy for a min heap 

build min heap runs min heapify on every element in the array.

Overall the assignment took us around 20 minutes to complete.
