1.) Advantagess: each primitive can be computed on it's own.
 leads to greater performance because each object doesn't have to be kept in memory.

Disadvantages: Global effects are more difficult to process and are not always accurate, such as the computation of shadows


1.2) You can use both triangles and quadrilaterals. Quadrilaterals can be drawn on lines of latitude and logitude through 4 connecting points.
after drawing, a digonal line splitting it creates 2 triangles.

1.8)  amount of pixels we have to process per second is 1280 x 1024 x 72  = 94371840 pixels  / second. In order to avoid flickering, 
memory must be available to evaluate at a pixel in 10 nanoseconds.

1.10) include geometric primitives like points, segments, curves, and surfaces. You could then apply transformations on these primatives. 

1.13) Moores Law states umber of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years.
	This means, the cost per rendered triangle is decreasing exponentially.  

	At 480 x 640 @ 60hz, the equation for the amount of pixels is 480 x 640 x 30 
	The memory requirements is 109 nanoseconds / pixel.

2.18) If the CRT monitor can display four colors, we have an accuracy of 2 bits/pixel in the frame. 
	Then we use 2^(3*2) = 64 different colors There are 4 of each RGB colors. The quality is low
